# Data Structures

In this repository I'll add all of my data structures implementations. Most of Algorithms are implemented by C programming language.
Enjoy! :)

### **Data Structures List:**

#### Linear Data Structure:
- [Stack - Basic Implementation] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Stack%20Implementation%20in%20C.cpp)
- [Stack - Parentheses Balance Checking] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Parentheses%20Balance%20Checking%20using%20Stack.cpp)
- [Queue - Basic Implementation] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Queue%20Implementation%20in%20C.cpp)
- [Conversion of Infix to Postfix notation. Evaluation of Postfix notation] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Infix%20to%20Postfix%20and%20Postfix%20evaluation.cpp)
- [Deque – Double-Ended Queue] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Deque%20-%20Double%20Ended%20Queue.cpp)
- [Linked List: Create, Print and Count the Item] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Linked%20List.c)
- [Linked List: Create, Insert, Search, Delete and Print operation] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Linked%20List%20%5Bcreate%2C%20insert%2C%20delete%2C%20search%5D.c)

#### Non-Linear Data Structure:
- [Tree - Binary Search Tree - BST [Insert, Search and Traversal]] (https://github.com/hasancse91/data-structures/blob/master/Source%20Code/Binary%20Search%20Tree%20%5BInsert-Search-Traverse%5D%20.c)
